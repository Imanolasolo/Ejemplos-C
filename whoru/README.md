Title: whoru.c

Author: Imanol Asolo (Code Codix)

This file is about I/O commands, I/O means In Out. In this file the program will ask us about our name and then will salute.

We use "printf" function to show the question and answer in the screen and "scanf" function to get our response from keyboard and store in the memory.

Note: We create the variable "me" with the text that we create in the keyboard.

As always, compile and run the "whoru" file with "gcc" and "./" instructions.
