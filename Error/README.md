Title: Error.c

Author: Imanol Asolo (Code Codix)

This file was created to show a error while compiling the 
error.c file.

When you compile the file the terminal shows you that is a error in 6th file, when the error is in 5th, thereÂ´s no a semicolon after the line, so the compiler will give you an error message.

To fix it you can put the semicolon and run gcc error.c -o error
in your terminal to compile the file.
