Title: justify.c

Author: Imanol Asolo (Code Codix)

This file is used to give a format to a string (created with "printf"), it start with % character followed by a s (means string) so &s means formatted string.

If we put a number between & and s, it means the size of string in characters so if i write %15s it means "print 15 empty spaces".

Note that in the file I wrote %-15s in file 6, it means to print 15 empty spaces from left side of string.

As always compile the file with "gcc" and run the executable file with ./
