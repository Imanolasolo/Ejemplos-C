Title: GOODBYE.c

Author: Imanol Asolo (Code Codix)

This exercise is created to show "Goodbye, cruel world!" sentence on the screen when we execute the program.

I used <stdio.h> as library because has the "printf" command instead.

"printf" is a command used to print characters or strings literally in this case.
