Title: whoru.c

Author: Imanol Asolo (Code Codix)

This file is about use escape character "\" to avoid errors when use "printf".
In the example when you compile "dblquote.c" the compiler gives you an error because the compiler canÂ´t read " character into a string, to avoid this error, you use "\" character before " and fix the error as shown in "dblquote1.c"

Tip, check the differences between "dblquote.c" and "dblquote1.c"

As always use "gcc" to compile and "./" to run the compiled file.
